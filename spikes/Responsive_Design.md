# Responsive Design

## Units

Everything we see on the web is made up of little dots of light: pixels. We have to think about if _thinking in terms of pixels_ while using CSS does actually make sense.

Not all screens are rendering the pixels the same way, as is apparent from the existence of various pixel geometries. With most modern displays using sub-pixel rendering, as well as the many different screen resolutions that are offered today, the notion of 1px has maybe a more fluid meaning in actuality. 1px of CSS in one screen can be 1px of a bigger pixel of CSS in another one with a higher resolution.

Realization: there is no pixel perfection!
