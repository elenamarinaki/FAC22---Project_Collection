# Intro to Node.JS 🥳

## Notes 📓

- The node.js provides an environment to run javascript applications outside the browser console.
- Limitations: we do not have access to DOM 🤷
- Advantages: we have the flexibility to run applications independently, without the use of an HTML file, build games, web servers etc.

### Process.argv ✨

- gives us access to the arguments we can pass to a javascript application
- Usage: node app.js [arguments...]
